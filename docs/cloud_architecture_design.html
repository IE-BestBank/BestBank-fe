                <p>
                    The infrastructure for the IE BestBank MVP is designed to ensure scalability, security, 
                    and cost-effectiveness, adhering to the functional and non-functional requirements 
                    of the application. By following a cloud-native approach and leveraging Microsoft 
                    Azure services, we implement a robust DTAP (Development, Testing, Acceptance, 
                    Production) environment strategy. This design aligns with the Azure Well-Architected 
                    Framework and integrates industry best practices.

                <h2>Environment Setup: DTAP Strategy</h2>
                <p>
                    IE BestBank's MVP employs a structured DTAP (Development, Testing, Acceptance, Production) 
                    strategy in order to improve and propelry ensure application lifecycle. The main reason behind as to why we deployed this strategy was to ensure 
                    that each stage operates independently, ensuring that errors or issues were not carried over to the next stage. This allowed us to ensure our stakeholders of
                    the quality of the application before it was deployed to production, increasing its reliability and trust.
                </p>

                <h2>Advantages of the DTAP Strategy</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improved quality of the application</li>
                    <li>Increased reliability and trust</li>
                    <li>Reduced risk of errors and issues</li>
                    <li>Enhanced collaboration between development and operations teams</li>

                <h1>12-Factor App Design</h1>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The 12-Factor App methodology outlines best practices for developing modern, scalable, and maintainable cloud-native applications. The IE BestBank MVP
                application adheres to these principles, ensuring a robust and efficient architecture. By following these guidelines, we achieve a high level of operational
                excellence, security, and reliability in our cloud-native design.
            </p>

            <h2>12-Factor Principles Applied</h2>

            <h3>1. Codebase</h3>
            <p>
                Maintain a single codebase tracked in revision control, with multiple deployments.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Implementation:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Source code is stored in a single GitHub organization made of 3 GitHub Repositories(Frontend, Backend, and Infra), enabling version control and collaboration.</li>
                    <li>CI/CD pipelines deploy the same codebase to multiple environments (Development, UAT, Production).</li>
                    <li>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates are version-controlled alongside the application codebase.
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Dependencies</h3>
            <p>
                Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Implementation:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Frontend and backend dependencies are explicitly declared in package.json and requirements.txt files, respectively.</li>
                    <li>Dependencies are containerized using Docker, ensuring consistent runtime environments across deployments.</li>
                    <li>Dependency versions are pinned to prevent unexpected changes and ensure reproducibility.
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Configuration</h3>
            <p>
                Store configuration in the environment.

                    <li>Secrets and sensitive information are securely managed and accessed through Key Vault integration.
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Backing Services</h3>
            <p>
