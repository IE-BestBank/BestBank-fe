                    Service Level Agreement (SLA) are agreements between a service provider and a customer that define the expected level of service. 
                    Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are specific, measurable goals that are designed to ensure that the SLA is met. 
                    Service Level Indicators (SLIs) are the metrics that are used to measure the performance of a service.

                <h4>Why These SLOs?</h4>
                <p>
                    These SLOs are a result of collaboration with BestBank’s full-stack developers, 
                    infrastructure developers, and the cloud architect. The team has chosen these SLOs 
                    for the time being, and they’re subject to change if they don’t reflect BestBank’s 
                    preferences in terms of monitoring.
                </p>
                <hr>

                <h4>Uptime</h4>
                <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Maintaining availability of the database and Key Vault is important 
                to the functionality of our application as downtime impacts the user experience and administrative 
                operations.</p>
                <p><strong>Threshold:</strong> The target of 99% uptime aligns with realistic infrastructure 
                constraints while meeting business needs.</p>
                <hr>

                <h4>Response Time</h4>
                <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Fast response times are vital for user satisfaction and operational 
                performance. Slow responses can lead to user frustration and loss of trust.</p>
                <p><strong>Threshold:</strong> The 2-second threshold balances the performance demands with system 
                capabilities.</p>
                <hr>

                <h4>Request Volume Tracking</h4>
                <p>
                    Monitoring request volume assures the system can handle traffic fluctuations and prevents 
                    bottlenecks. It also helps in identifying trends in user activity.
                </p>
                <hr>

                <h4>Failed Connection Rate</h4>
                <p>
                    Database connection failures can indicate underlying issues in the system. Limiting these 
                    failures ensures system reliability and reduces downtime risks.
                </p>
                <hr>

                <h4>Error Rate</h4>
                <p>
                    Failed HTTP requests (5xx errors) indicate server issues. Keeping error rates below 1% 
                    ensures a seamless experience for users and meets SLA expectations.
                </p>

                <h4>Service Level Indicators (SLIs) Rationale</h4>
                <p>
                    Measuring and monitoring important metrics with Azure tools is part of the SLI implementation process. 
                    Application Insights' custom metrics are used to measure response time, with queries summarizing average 
                    response time, while Azure Monitor's availability tests are used to track uptime. The connection reliability
                     is tracked using PostgreSQL logs in Log Analytics, while the request volume is obtained from Azure Log 
                     Analytics, which groups HTTP requests by hour. Last but not least, error rates are computed to monitor the 
                     proportion of unsuccessful HTTP requests using Application Insights and Log Analytics. In order to improve 
                     SLOs and SLIs based on performance and feedback, the next steps involve validating all SLIs using these tools 
                     and performing quarterly reviews. Sections of pertinent design documents are linked for more information.

                <h3>Monitoring Strategy</h3>
                <p>
                    The Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team at BestBank created this document to describe 
                    the monitoring plan they used to make sure the application complies with the SLA and meets its SLOs.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Type of Monitoring</h3>
                <p>
                    The selected monitoring strategy is focused on application monitoring and fault tolerance, 
                    which includes tracking both infrastructure-level and application-level metrics to ensure 
                    system reliability, performance, and availability. Future implementations could also include 
                    capability monitoring.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Data Collection Points</h3>
                <p>
                    Data collection points of our monitoring strategy include telemetry data sent to our 
                    application insights by the frontend and backend of the application in addition to diagnostic 
                    settings of selected Azure resources which have been configured to send logs to our log analytics 
                    workspace.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Tool Used</h3>
                <p>
                    Azure Workbooks with Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries are used to visualize metrics and provide 
                    actionable insights. The Workbook includes:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Uptime Monitoring:</strong> Visualizes the availability of the database and Key Vault with uptime percentages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Latency Analysis:</strong> Displays average HTTP response times to ensure they remain within the defined threshold (SLO: &lt;2 seconds).</li>
                    <li><strong>Throughput Tracking:</strong> Shows the number of HTTP requests processed hourly to monitor traffic patterns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Error Rate Monitoring:</strong> Tracks 5xx errors to ensure the error rate stays below 1%.</li>
                    <li><strong>Database Connection Reliability:</strong> Monitors failed database connection attempts and ensures they remain below the 10% threshold.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> Additional information and metrics are also being monitored in the current 
                    version of BestBank’s workbook. While these could not directly connect to any of our selected 
                    SLOs, BestBank’s site reliability engineering team chose to keep them as a source of data for 
                    the application. This comes from the desire of BestBank being an intelligent data-driven organization.

                <p>
                    The Azure Workbook used for the monitoring strategy has been translated into a Bicep module 
                    (implemented via Infrastructure as Code). This aligns with BestBank’s practice of employing 
                    modularization of services and resources for reusability and consistency.

                <h3>Incidence Response Approach</h3>
                <p>
                    This document outlines the incident response approach implemented by BestBank’s 
                    Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team to address cases where any of the selected 
                    Service Level Objectives (SLOs) is at risk of being violated.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Objectives of Implementing an Incident Response Strategy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Minimize Downtime:</strong> Ensure incidents are resolved promptly to maintain SLA compliance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-Time Alerts:</strong> Enable rapid detection of incidents and notify the relevant team members.</li>
                    <li><strong>Structured Response:</strong> Follow a defined workflow to assess, triage, and resolve incidents.</li>
                    <li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> Review and learn from incidents to prevent recurrence.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>

                <h3>Alerting Workflow</h3>
                <p>
                    For the alerting workflow, we used Logic Apps that help automate the process in addition to Slack, 
                    which is the chosen communication platform by BestBank. We created a channel for the alerts, 
                    where we configured an “API” which has a webhook URL that was utilized by the HTTP POST to Slack 
                    method in the alerting workflow. This will be further elaborated on later in this document.
                </p>
                <hr>

                <h3>Key Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Recurrence Trigger:</strong> The Logic App is triggered every 5 minutes to ensure timely checks for alerts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Slack Notification:</strong> Sends an HTTP POST request to the Slack Webhook URL with the alert message.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customizable Alerts:</strong> The alert message can be modified to include additional details in the future, 
                        such as severity and affected services.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Incident Management Workflow</h3>
                <p>BestBank’s SRE team chose to employ the following incident management workflow:</p>

                <h4>Detect</h4>
                <p>
                    Based on the alert rules defined, if any of the rules is satisfied, we proceed to the alerting stage.
                </p>
                <hr>

                <h4>Alert</h4>
                <p>
                    The Logic App sends a real-time notification to the Slack channel, alerting the team about the incident.
                </p>
                <hr>

                <h4>Acknowledge</h4>
                <p>
                    As BestBank is committed to being transparent, users will be informed about the issue and any potential 
                    outages or disruptions (possibly through a notification on the website). Future implementations could 
                    include personalized email notifications to affected users.
                </p>
                <hr>

                <h4>Investigate</h4>
                <p>
                    The SRE team reviews diagnostic data to identify the cause of the issue. This includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Checking logs in Log Analytics for anomalies.</li>
                    <li>Reviewing metrics in Azure Workbooks for patterns or spikes.</li>
                    <li>Using tools like Application Insights for detailed performance analysis.</li>
                    <li>Relevant team members (e.g., developers, infrastructure engineers) are called based on the 
                        nature of the problem.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <hr>

                <h4>Resolve</h4>
                <p>
                    The responsible team, in collaboration with the SRE team, works on implementing a fix. 
                    The resolution process includes:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deploying changes to the development and User Acceptance Testing (UAT) environments.</li>
                    <li>Verifying the fix in these environments before deploying it to production.</li>
                </ul>

                <hr>
                <h4>Post-Mortem</h4>
                <p>
                    After the incident is resolved, a post-mortem is conducted to analyze the issue and improve future responses. 
                    In this meeting, the team will analyze the problem and discuss what could be done to avoid similar problems 
                    in the future. This aligns with BestBank’s generative culture, which aims to avoid blame and encourages 
                    shared responsibility for incidents.
                </p>

                <hr>
                <h4>Future Action (if applicable)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implement measures to prevent recurrence of the incident, including adjusting monitoring thresholds 
                        for earlier detection.
                    </li>
                    <li>Automate resolution steps for repetitive issues.</li>
                    <li>Add specific dashboards or queries for improved visibility.</li>
                    <li>Conduct training sessions to improve response times and processes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Automation</h3>
                <p>
                    The Logic App and the alert rules used to implement this incident response strategy were translated into 
                    Bicep modules (implemented via Infrastructure as Code). This practice supports BestBank’s focus on 
                    modularization, reusability, and consistency in managing services and resources.
                </p>
                <hr>

                <p>
                    This incident response design ensures that BestBank is equipped to handle incidents effectively, minimize downtime, 
                    and continuously improve system reliability to meet user expectations and SLA commitments.
                </p>

                <h3>Engineering Design</h3>
                <h3>Monitoring Design and Implementation</h3>
                <p>
                    As discussed earlier, BestBank has invested in site reliability engineering. 
                    The first step was a collaboration between the SRE team with the full-stack developers, 
                    infrastructure developers, and the cloud architect to define Service Level Objectives (SLOs) 
                    and corresponding Service Level Indicators (SLIs). This step allowed BestBank to state clear 
                    performance targets such as uptime and error rates. Afterward, the site reliability engineers 
                    collaborated with infrastructure developers and full-stack developers to configure the 
                    resources to send telemetry data and diagnostic settings to Azure Application Insights and a 
                    Log Analytics Workspace.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Implementing a monitoring strategy will contribute to greater well-being for practitioners, 
                    as well as organizational and operational performance. This ensures the team can identify 
                    potential issues early (related to defining SLOs) and reduce downtime and production outages 
                    (achieved by implementing disaster recovery plans and improvement work whenever reliability 
                    targets are missed), leading to improved operational performance and thus organizational 
                    performance.
                </p>

                <h3>Incident Response</h3>
                <p>
                    As discussed earlier, BestBank’s SRE team worked on implementing an incident response approach 
                    to ensure that any outages are reported before users start complaining and raising issues. 
                    The incident response design was implemented using Azure Logic Apps and alert rules defined 
                    in a Bicep module.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Our Log Analytics Workspace and Application Insights receive continuous telemetry and diagnostic 
                    data, allowing for real-time anomaly detection. The Logic App has a recurrence trigger set up to 
                    check for alerts every hour. If an alert condition is met, it notifies the designated team channel 
                    via an HTTP POST request to a Slack Webhook URL. Service Level Objectives (SLOs), including 
                    error rates, response times, and uptime, form the basis for alert definitions. Future improvements 
                    might include more thorough alert messages that include contextual details like the affected area 
                    or suggested next actions.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Our Slack webhook URL is not exposed in our code; it is saved as a repository 
                secret in the infrastructure repository and passed to the relevant modules accordingly.</p>

                <hr>
                <h3>Capacity Design</h3>
                <p>
                    To ensure BestBank's application can adapt to varying workloads and maintain top performance, 
                    the following scalability and resource management strategies have been implemented:

                    scale resources automatically, ensuring uninterrupted performance during traffic surges.
                </p>

                <br>
                <h4>Other Services Robustness</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>Reliable Authentication:</strong> Monitor Key Vault usage to prevent throttling 
                    during authentication peaks, ensuring secure and consistent access to secrets.
                </p>

                <hr>
                <h3>Performance Efficiency</h3>
                <p>
                    BestBank assures that the desired performance is achieved by implementing various strategies 
                    that handle different workloads. Backend performance is improved by using efficient API designs, 
                    asynchronous calls, and caching to minimize response times. Indexing and partitioning techniques 
                    improve query execution speeds and support large datasets during high traffic periods.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Application Insights monitors application dependencies to identify potential performance 
                    bottlenecks. Traffic patterns are simulated using Azure Load Testing to refine resource 
                    configurations so that SLOs are always met under stress conditions. These methods guarantee 
                    reliability and performance.

                <h2>Cost Optimization</h2>
                <p>
                    BestBank uses a process for cost optimization to utilize resources effectively and minimize 
                    expenses. It leverages Azure Cost Management dashboards for real-time expenditure tracking 
                    and insights into usage. Budgets and alerts on expenses keep costs within predefined limits. 
                    Prepaying for reserved instances reduces operational costs for predictable workloads. 
                    Auto-scaling ensures instances are not over-provisioned, preventing unnecessary expense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Collaboration is central to BestBank's cost optimization strategy. The team jointly reviews 
                    Azure costs, ensuring accountability and transparency in resource allocation. Resource tagging 
                    policies will allocate costs across departments and projects accurately. Thus, BestBank 
                    maintains an optimized cloud infrastructure while adhering to financial objectives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Future Implementations:</strong>  
                    Use AI tools to find additional cost-saving opportunities and automate resource management.  
                    Improve automated systems to adjust resources and remove unused ones, saving time and money.
                </p>

                <h2>Operational Excellence and Release Engineering</h2>

                </ul>

                <h3>Release Engineering</h3>
                <p>
                    The release engineering team collaborates with development and infrastructure teams to 
                    standardize workflows, define clear SLAs for minimal disruption, and foster continuous 
                    improvement through retrospectives and post-mortems.
                </p>

                <h2>Reliability Design</h2>
                <p>
                    BestBank ensures that its system remains functional, meets performance objectives, and 
                    recovers from failures by addressing data loss, downtime, and service availability.
                </p>

                <h3>High Availability</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Configured Azure Traffic Manager for Regional Failover:</strong> Routes traffic 
                        between multiple regions. If a region fails, Traffic Manager redirects traffic to another region.</li>
                    <li><strong>Replication of PostgreSQL:</strong> A copy of the database in another Azure region 
                        ensures seamless failover if the primary database becomes unavailable.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Resiliency</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stateless Services:</strong> Services avoid reliance on specific instances. External 
                        storage (e.g., Azure Redis Cache) maintains state, allowing smooth failover and scaling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Retry Policies:</strong> Retry mechanisms handle temporary issues like network timeouts, 
                        ensuring critical operations (e.g., payment processing) succeed after transient failures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Circuit Breakers:</strong> Temporarily halts requests to failing services, preventing 
                        system-wide disruptions and allowing affected services time to recover.</li>
                </ul>
