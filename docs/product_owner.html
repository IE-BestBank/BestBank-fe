                        <li>The User Portal is designed for individual customers to manage their bank accounts 
                            with ease. To onboard new users, the portal includes a simple and secure registration 
                            process. Users can create an account by providing a unique username, confirming their 
                            password, and completing basic form validations. Upon successful registration, the 
                            system automatically generates a new bank account with a random account number, 
                            ready for immediate use
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>After logging in, users gain access to a personalized dashboard that displays their 
                            associated bank accounts and recent transactions. The portal emphasizes user security, 
                            requiring credentials to be hashed and securely stored in the backend database

                            <li>Fund Transfers: Customers can seamlessly transfer money to other accounts 
                                within the bank by specifying the recipient’s account number and the transfer 
                                amount. The system ensures that the transfer amount does not exceed the account balance, 
                                safeguarding users from overdrafts
